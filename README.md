# Lessphp for Kirby v2

This is a preprocessor for Less files. Built using the [lessphp library](https://github.com/leafo/lessphp) by Leaf Corcoran and [lessphp plugin for Kirby v1](https://github.com/janstieler/kirby-lessphp) by Jan Stieler. This plugin will automatically process Less files.

1. Copy folder ‘lessphp’ inside ‘plugins’ to Kirby’s plugin folder.
2. Copy file ‘less.php’ inside ‘snippet’ to Kirby’s snippet folder.
3. Call the snippet with <?php snippet('less') ?> in your HTML head.
4. Create a folder ‘less’ inside Kirby’s assets folder.
5. Create a file ‘style.less’ and place it inside ‘assets/less’.
6. Make sure a folder ‘css’ exists inside Kirby’s assets folder.
